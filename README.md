# canvas-dot-matrix-wipe
Creates a solid color wipe inside of a div as part of a transition

I created this after seeing noticing an animated wipe on super smash brothers ultimate. I started mimicking the same wipe but only spend an hour or so on it. It's a little buggy and doesn't work EXACTLY like I envisioned but I'm bored with it, maybe I'll give it more love later.

I tried to find a youtube clip of where the idea came from but couldn't find anything so I'll try to explain it in detail below:
I wanted to create a transition wipe using a print-style (think color news paper image) dot matrx where the individual dots would grow until they connected to each other, creating a smooth transition.

What I would focus on next:
- Set angle 0-359 (which also controls direction)
- Set color
- Allow wipe to be a mask for another canvas

- Potentially convert to CSS / CSS mask
